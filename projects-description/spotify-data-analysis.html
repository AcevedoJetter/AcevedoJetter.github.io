      <p>
        Created a script which analyze the streams since creating your account.
      </p>

      <p>
        How to get the data: The folder that you have should contain your entire
        streaming history data for the life of your account. This can be
        obtained by pressing the <code>Request data</code> button in
        <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/">this website</a>
        if you are logged in to your account. Make sure to select the field that
        says <code>Select Extended streaming history</code>. After some weeks,
        you will get an email with the extended streaming history. After
        downloading it, you will have a zip file called
        <code>my_spotify_data.zip</code> and when opened the directory is
        <code>MyData</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>MyData</code> will contain a pdf file which details the
        contents of the other files in the directory. The files we care about
        are the ones that start with <code>Streaming_History_Audio</code> and
        are json files.
      </p>

      <p>

        Example of the streaming data of one song can be seen in the image on
        top of this page
      </p>

      <p>
        All the functions in <code>main.py</code> have docstrings which contains
        the parameters of the function and it also contains what is returned by
        the function. Note that the columns of the pandas DataFrame returned by
        <code>get_all_data()</code> can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/AcevedoJetter/spotify-data-analysis#mydata"
          >here</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        How to run <code>main.py</code> in the terminal First, make sure that
        the <code>MyData</code> directory is in the same directory as
        <code>main.py</code>. After this, you should run
        <code>python3 main.py</code> and it will create a txt file called
        <code>analysis.txt</code> which will contain the analyzed data after
        running the functions of <code>main.py</code> using the data from the
        <code>MyData</code> directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>analysis.txt</code> file contains the following analysis of
        the data from the <code>MyData</code> directory:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Total Time Listened</li>
        <li>Most Streamed Artist by time</li>
        <li>Most Streamed Artist by songs played</li>
        <li>Most Streamed Songs by time played</li>
        <li>Most Streamed Songs by amount of times played</li>
        <li>Percent of songs on shuffle vs not on shuffle</li>
        <li>Percent of songs played offline vs played online</li>
        <li>Reasons a song started with their respective percentage</li>
        <li>Reasons a song ended with their respective percentage</li>
      </ul>
