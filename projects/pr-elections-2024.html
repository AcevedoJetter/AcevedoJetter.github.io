    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>
      This project was completed in November 2024, right after the Puerto Rico
      General Elections. The goal of the project was to create a web scraper to
      collect election results data and visualize it in an easy-to-understand
      format. The above image shows the final results for the Governor race in
      Puerto Rico.
    </p>

    <p>
      Created a web scraper to collect data from the
      <a href="https://elecciones2024.ceepur.org/"
        >2024 Puerto Rico General Elections</a
      >, held on November 5, 2024. The data was sourced from the official
      website of the
      <a href="https://www.ceepur.org/"
        >Puerto Rico State Elections Commission (CEE)</a
      >
      and contains all the offices and special election at the island, district,
      and municipal levels. These are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Governor</li>
      <li>Resident Commissioner</li>
      <li>Senators At-Large</li>
      <li>Representatives At-Large</li>
      <li>District Senators</li>
      <li>District Representatives</li>
      <li>Mayors</li>
      <li>Municipal Legislators</li>
      <li>President</li>
      <li>Status Plebiscite</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technologies used:</h3>

    <p>
      The scraper uses Selenium to scrape the website since the content loads
      dynamically. Then, used Pandas to format the data. The data is then saved
      in CSV format for further analysis. Additionally, it is visualized using
      Matplotlib and GeoPandas to create the map and PIL to make the GIFs
    </p>

    <h3>Map details:</h3>

    <p>
      The colors in the map represent the political party of the winning
      candidate at the moment the data was collected. The parties are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Blue:
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Progressive_Party_(Puerto_Rico)"
          >Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Red:

          >Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana (MVC)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Cyan:

          >Proyecto Dignidad (PD)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Gray: Tie</li>
      <li>White: No data reported</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      From now on, the parties will be identified with their abbreviation (PNP,
      PPD, PIP, MVC, PD)
    </p>

    <h3>Findings:</h3>

    <p>
      The following GIFs were made with the data scraped every five minutes the
      night of the election:
    </p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">
        <div class="caption">Governor</div>
        <img src="../images/gobernador.gif" alt="Governor results GIF" />
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <div class="caption">Resident Commissioner</div>
        <img
          src="../images/comisionado-residente.gif"
          alt="Resident Commissioner results GIF"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <div class="caption">Mayor</div>
        <img src="../images/alcalde.gif" alt="Mayor results GIF" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Like in nearly all elections, we can see how different municipalities
      changed winners as the night progressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Governor election:</b> Since the first ballots came in, the winner for
      this race since the beginning, Jenniffer Gonzalez (PNP), was ahead. In the
      first few updates, the second place was for Jesus Manuel Ortiz (PPD), but
      as more data came in, the second place changed dramatically between the
      candidates from the PPD and PIP. For the first time in the history of the
      PPD, the party did not finish first or second in the gubernatorial
      election. We can see from the GIF that the majority of the municipalities
      that were red (PPD) then turned blue (PNP). The PIP candidate, Juan
      Dalmau, finished second, making this the best election for the party in
      its history. Juan Dalmau obtained many votes of the in person voting but
      when the counted votes from the early ballots came in, Jenniffer Gonzalez
      gained thousands of votes, helping her secure the victory. It is important
      to note that the PIP and the MVC had a pre-election pact to not run
      against each other in certain municipalities, which helped both parties
      gain more votes and said to vote for the candidate of the PIP in the
      Governor race and the candidate of the MVC in the Resident Commissioner.
      This election is the third in a row where the PNP has won the race for
      Governor.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Resident Commissioner election:</b> This race was very straight
      forward, having a clear winner since the beginning, Pablo Jose Hernandez
      (PPD). The second place was also clear from the start, William Villafañe
      (PNP). This race did not have many changes during the night, but the main
      ones were from PNP to the favor the PPD. For the last place, it was very
      close were the candidate from the PIP got 4.93% of the votes and the
      candidate of the PD got 4.96% of the votes. The win of Pablo Jose
      Hernandez breaks the streak of the PNP winning the Resident Commissioner
      race. The last Resident Commissioner from a party that is not the PNP was
      Anibal Acevedo Vila (PPD), who won in 2000.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mayor elections:</b> As per usual, the 78 mayor races had a winner
      being either from the PNP or PPD. In the last two elections, 2020 and
      2024, the mayor election in San Juan has had a third candidate from the
      MVC, which has made the election interesting in the municipality. In both
      elections, the PNP candidate, Miguel Romero, won the election, but with
      Manuel Natal (MVC) in a relative close second place. We can see in the
      second frame of the GIF that Natal was in first place for the first data
      release from San Juan, but as more data came in, the PNP candidate, Miguel
      Romero, took the lead and won the election. At the end of the event, the
      PNP won 37 municipalities and the PPD won 41.
