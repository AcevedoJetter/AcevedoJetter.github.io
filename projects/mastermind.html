    <p>
      Implemented the board game of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)"
        >Mastermind</a
      >
      and will create a solver which uses the Five-guess algorithm. The
      algorithm will always win the game in at most 5 turns.
    </p>

    <p>Once the game begins, you should take the first guess.</p>

    <p>
      To guess, write the first letter of the color you would like to guess. The
      six colors are the following: red <code>r</code>, blue <code>b</code>,
      yellow <code>y</code>, green <code>g</code>, orange <code>o</code>, and
      purple <code>p</code>. A guess consist of four colors, which could be
      repeated, separated by a space. Examples: <code>r b g y</code>,
      <code>r r b o</code>, <code>p p p p</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the first guess, you will get a message with the amount of black key
      pegs and white key pegs in no specific order. A black key peg means that
      you got a color in the correct position and a white key peg means that you
      have a correct color but in the wrong position. This will be given as four
      strings <code>b</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>_</code> for black key
      peg, white key peg, and not a black key peg nor a white key peg,
      respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      This will continue until you get the correct combination or you have used
      all your guesses.
    </p>

    <p>To play, run the file in the terminal: <code>python3 main.py</code></p>
